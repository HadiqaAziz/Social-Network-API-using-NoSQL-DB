# Social Network API using NoSQL DB

This repository contains the files for a Social Network API designed to work with a NoSQL database. Ideal for social media startups, this API utilizes MongoDB to manage and handle large volumes of unstructured data efficiently.

## Features

- **API Endpoints**: Access and manage users, thoughts, reactions, and friendships.
- **Database Integration**: Mongoose models sync with a MongoDB database.
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete users, thoughts, and reactions.
- **Friend Management**: Add and remove friends from a user's friend list.

2. **Install Dependencies**

3. **Start the Server**

   Start the server and sync Mongoose models with MongoDB:

4. **Test API Endpoints**

   Use Insomnia (or another API testing tool) to test the following routes:

   - **GET Routes**: Fetch users and thoughts in JSON format.
